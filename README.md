# Exam-Predictor
Predicts with high accuracy the score a student will get on an exam depending on several variables, then models the data.

Uses Pandas, Scikit-Learn, MatPlotLib, and Seaborn to parse through a CSV and convert into a dataframe, then cleans up missing and categorical data, trains a model, and plots it.
